\chapter{Conclusion}
There was created a weather application which met the requirements.
The implementation of different file types, visualizing and database integration, to make it easier and to get higher performance, are completed in that way it was required from the beginning. 
The implementation that did not finish, was the NC-files, due the troubles with CSV and WRK. This and coordinates converting were not implemented, due there were no test data with other coordinates, but as earlier stated, this can be implemented.

The use of Git was much better than Dropbox, that was used in the beginning, and allowed all group members to change files without too much concern for conflicts. 

The final product ended up being a satisfied solution for a weather application.
