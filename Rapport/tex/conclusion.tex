\chapter{Conclusion}
There was created a weather application which met the requirements.
The implementation of different file types and visualizing are done. The database integration, to make it easier and to get higher performance, is done. All this by using open source software.
The implementation of NC-files, was not done due the troubles with CSV and WRK. As earlier stated this can be implemented.

The use of Git was much better than Dropbox, that was used in the beginning, and allowed all group members to change files without too much concern for conflicts.
