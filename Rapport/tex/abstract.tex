Data for weather analysis and forecasts consists of enormous amounts of data.

To predict the weather, a lot of variables are in play including wind speed, pressure and tendency.

Comparing huge amounts of data quickly becomes difficult. Most people interpret images easier than numbers, hence the need for some sort of visualization for the data sets.

Today no free application exists for visualizing the weather data except for two earlier attempts: one in MATLAB and one with Google Maps. These earlier application were not flexible enough to be used in a bigger context.

This report shows the development and considerations throughout the project of an application that might serve as the beginning of a new common open source platform for analyzing, visualizing and comparing weather related data.
