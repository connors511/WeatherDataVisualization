In the following it is implied that the chosen solutions for each step - e.g. if more than one option is possible - are compliant with the TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Download the source from \url{https://github.com/connors511/WeatherDataVisualization} in \textsf{/application}.
\item Set up a webserver to host the application, either locally or on the World Wide Web.
\item Create a database and set the connection information in \textsf{App/fuel/config/development/db.php}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
php oil g r migrate
\end{lstlisting}
\item Set up the \textsf{preparedata} task as a cron job (should be started when the webserver starts, i.e. run constantly).
\item Log in to the application with username/password: \textsf{admin/admin}.
