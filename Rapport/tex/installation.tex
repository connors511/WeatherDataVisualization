In the following it is implied that the chosen solutions for each step - e.g. if more than one option is possible - are compliant with the stated requirements in section \ref{sec:application_requirements}.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Download the source\footnote{\url{https://github.com/connors511/WeatherDataVisualization}}.
\item Set up a server to host the software, either locally or on the World Wide Web.
\item Create a database and set the connection information in \textsf{fuel/config/development/db.php}
\item Create the database tables. This can be done by running the following with \textsf{Oil} in command line:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
php oil r migrate
\end{lstlisting}
\item Set up the \textsf{preparedata} task as a cron job (should be started when the server starts). The command to start is
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
php oil r preparedata
\end{lstlisting}
\item Log in to the application with username/password: \textsf{admin/admin}.
\end{enumerate}
