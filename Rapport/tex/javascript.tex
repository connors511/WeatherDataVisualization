\chapter{JavaScript}
There has been used JavaScript to load and visualize data. It gives a more smooth design, since the pages don't have to reload every time, but can be loaded in background.

The JavaScript framework there has been used is jQuery, because of the very well documentation. jQuery is one of the most popular JavaScript library and is free open source software. The animations for map and chart are made by using jQuery.
 
One of the techniques with jQuery is for instance AJAX\footnote{Asynchronous JavaScript and XML}, which enables the chart to send data to, and retrieve data from, the server without reloading page. Data is retrieved using XMLHttpRequest, since the data is ready in JSON\footnote{JavaScript Object Notation}.

If the browser doesn't support JavaScript, the user still have access to upload files, but not viewing data from map or chart.
