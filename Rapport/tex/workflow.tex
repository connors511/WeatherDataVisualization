\chapter{Work flow}
At the beginning we used dropbox\footnote{A web based file hosting service}\todo[color=red,fancyline]{reference} to create a folder we all could read and write to. It was fine at the beginning, but later when we were changing each other's files, it started to get a little problematic, since dropbox doesn't have a smart merging algorithm.
Then we tried using git\todo[color=red,fancyline]{footnote + reference} to push and pull data from each other. We used git, because of the merging algorithm and we are familiar with it.\\
Github\todo[color=red,fancyline]{footnote + reference} allows you to view older files and list commits\footnote{Every time a person push data to git, he also gives a comment of what he has done. In that way it is easier to get an overview of changes.} from users through the whole project.\\
Git also allow other users to look at the program and and test it by them self, so it is accessible for all.
