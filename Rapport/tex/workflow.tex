\chapter{Work flow \& distribution}
\label{sec:work_flow_and_distribution}
At the beginning Dropbox\footnote{A web based file hosting service - see \cite{Dropbox}} was used for sharing files between us, using a shared folder all members could read and write to. It was fine at the beginning, but later when there became file conflicts , it started to get a little problematic, since Dropbox doesn't have a smart merging algorithm.
A public repository was created at GitHub\footnote{A web based hosting service using Git - see \cite{GitHub}} to centralize the project files and allow for easier collaboration with its improved merging algorithm over Dropbox's.

GitHub allows you to view older files and list commits\footnote{Every time a person pushes data with Git, he also gives a comment of what he has done. In that way it is easier to get an overview of changes.} from users through the whole project.

Since GitHub is used, everyone can access the repository\footnote{Repository \url{http://github.com/connors511/WeatherDataVisualization}} by themselves. Visitors can not change or commit data, but can download the software and give comments to the project.

\section{Distribution}
\label{sec:distribution}
As this software project has been carried out by a group, we have been working together as a team with constructive criticism of each other, spelling and syntax correction ect. This means that everyone has more or less had a hand in every part of the software. However:

Mads Lundt has had the main responsibility of the following parts of the project:
\begin{itemize}
\item Design
\item Map (HTML + JavaScript)
\item Appendix \ref{ap:usecase}
\end{itemize}

Matthias Larsen has had the main responsibility of the following parts of the project:
\begin{itemize}
\item Data Parser (C++)
\item JavaScript objectification
\item Appendix \ref{ap:csv}
\item API (PHP \& Report)
\end{itemize}

Joachim Jensen has had the main responsibility of the following parts of the project:
\begin{itemize}
\item Administration (PHP)
\item Database
\item Appendix \ref{ap:installation}
\end{itemize}
