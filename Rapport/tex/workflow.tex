\chapter{Work flow}
At the beginning we used dropbox to create a folder we all could read and write to. It was well at the beginning, but later when we were changing each other's files, that was very problematic, since dropbox doesn't have a smart merging algorithm.
Then we tried using git to push and pull data\footnote{Upload and download data from a server} from each other. We used git, because of the merging algorithm and we are familiar with it.\\
Github allows you to view older files and list commits\footnote{Every time a person push data to git, he also gives a comment of what he has done. In that way it is easier to get an overview of changes.} from users through the whole project.
