\chapter{Work flow}
At the beginning we used Dropbox\footnote{A web based file hosting service - see \cite{Dropbox}} to create a folder we all could read and write to. It was fine at the beginning, but later when we were changing each other's files, it started to get a little problematic, since Dropbox doesn't have a smart merging algorithm.
We created a repository at Git\footnote{A web based hosting service - see \cite{Git}} to push and pull data to the git server, so we could change each other's files without conflicts. We used Git, because of the merging algorithm and we are familiar with it.

Git allows you to view older files and list commits\footnote{Every time a person push data to Git, he also gives a comment of what he has done. In that way it is easier to get an overview of changes.} from users through the whole project.

Git also allow other users to look at the program and and test it by them self, so it is accessible for all.
