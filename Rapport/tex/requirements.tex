\chapter{Requirements}
\todo[inline,caption={requirements}]{This was requirements to the application, set by supervisors}
We stated some requirements to the final product, that should be fulfilled. 
The requirements:
\begin{itemize}
\item Web based software using opensource software.
\item Upload data to server in seperate files and compressed files.
\item Analyse and read data from CSV, WRK and NC-files.
\item Visualize the data in a nice user-friendly way.
\item Several performance requirements
\end{itemize}
We created the web based software using opensource.\\
It is allowed to upload CSV, WRK and zip-files.\\
We didn't do the implementation for the NC-files, because of difficulty and time pressure. However, CSV and WRK-files are working just fine, even if they both are compressed into one zip-file.

The visualizing of data are done in very user-friendly and cool design. We used a lot javascript, to create this cool and user-friendly design.

The performance is very good and the server is doing the most work, so even computers with poor specifications can access. We have done some caching\footnote{A collection of data duplicating original values stored on the server or by the client's web browser}, to get better performance too.
