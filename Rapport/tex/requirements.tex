The project was given some initial specification to serve as a starting point and is listed below.
\begin{itemize}
\item Efficient system for data request, retrieval and display
\item Handling of animations
\item Preference to open source software

\end{itemize}

Besides the initial specifications given, the following additional requirements were added to increase performance and ensure a smooth user experience:
\begin{itemize}
\item Upload data in seperate files and compressed containers\footnote{e.g. zip files}
\item Use of caching\footnote{A collection of data duplicating original values stored on the server or by the client's web browser}
\item Highly flexible and extensible
\end{itemize}
