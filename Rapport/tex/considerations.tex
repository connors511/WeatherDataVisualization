\chapter{Considerations}
Through the project we had some considerations:
\begin{itemize}
\item Comparing windfarms.
\item Radar name on map
\item List WRK-files in a smart way
\end{itemize}
We were thinking about comparing windfarms, so the client should be able to open more windfarms in different pop ups. The final product only supports one pop up, because it would quickly become confusing.\\
Listing WRK-files in a smart way, like list WRK-files in daily view instead of listing them for every 10th minutes. This wasn't implemented, since we would like the user to have more control, so instead of deleting a file for the whole day, the user can delete files for every 10th minute.
