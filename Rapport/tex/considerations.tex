\chapter{Considerations}
Through the project we had some considerations:
\begin{itemize}
\item Comparing windfarms.
\item Radar name on map.
\item List WRK-files in a smart way.
\item File types
\item Radar visualization
\item Map design
\item Chart design
\item Windmill icons
\end{itemize}
We were thinking about comparing windfarms, so the client should be able to open more windfarms in different pop ups. The final product only supports one pop up, because it would quickly become confusing.\\
Listing WRK-files in a smart way, like list WRK-files in daily view instead of listing them for every 10th minutes. This wasn't implemented, since we would like the user to have more control, so instead of deleting a file for the whole day, the user can delete files for every 10th minute.\\
We started with the CSV-files for windfarms, since the data was easy to read. After that, we tried WRK-files, which was a little more advanced.\\
Radar visualization..\\
We had multiple design suggestions for map and chart design. At the beginning we had a scroll-in/out sidebar, which could be show/hidden. This quickly became annoying, so it was replaced by a top bar. It was important that the menu could stay hidden or didn't cover up to much of the map.\\
We wanted to have windmill icons for windfarms on the map. These were very difficult to find on the internet, so at the end we created one by our self in Photoshop. One of the problems here was to get a windmill that could easy be seen on the very bright map.
