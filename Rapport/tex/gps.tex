\chapter{GPS coordinates}
There are several ways to locate positions on a map. We have used \emph{conjugate graticule}\footnote{Latitude/Longitude also known as conjugate graticule}, because the test data we had available used this. We haven't implemented for other GPS coordinates than latitude and longitude, because of the time pressure.

We know that there are other methods to get GPS coordinates - one of them is \emph{Degrees, Minutes, Seconds}. In a circle there are 360 degrees, so to get a minute each degree is split up into 60 parts, $\frac{1}{60}$ of a degree. To get seconds each minute is split up into 60 parts, $\frac{1}{60}$ of a minute.

To convert \emph{Degrees, Minutes, Seconds} into latitude and longitude, just simply use the formula:
$$Degrees~ + \left(Minutes~ \cdot \frac{1}{60}\right) + \left(Seconds~ \cdot \frac{1}{60} \cdot \frac{1}{60}\right)$$

Converting the other way around should be a bit more difficult, but since openstreetmap is using latitude and longitude, this isn't necessary.
