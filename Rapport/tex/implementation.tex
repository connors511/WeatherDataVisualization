\section{The use of frameworks}
Using frameworks because of the decreased development time due to already developed and tested libraries for various tasks such as database accesss, file handling and file uploading.

\section{Backend}
\subsection{The C++ application}
\subsubsection{Why a C++ application?}
We're using a C++ application because it is much faster to parse huge files in C++ than PHP or JavaScript.
The choice of language was because we had some knowledge of both C and C++. C++ is object oriented where as C is a procedural language, and seeing as we all favour object oriented programming, the choice between the two was easy.

We could have chosen other languages such as F, F\#, Java, Perl or Ruby, but our limited knowledge about these made us stick with C++, which is also quite fast and portable.

\subsubsection{Why Qt?}
We've decided to use Qt because of the support and community around it. It's very mature and most importantly, object oriented.

Qt is a cross-platform application framework developed by Nokia. Popular software such as Skype, VLC media player and VirtualBox along with companies as Google, HP, Philips and Samsung uses it.

Qt makes developing an application with a GUI\footnote{Graphical User Interface} relatively easy, but we've opted to only use the command line part of Qt, because the programming is run by the application and not by a user.

\subsubsection{Return codes}
The PHP part of the application gets a return code from the C++ application depending on how the parsing went and reacts accordingly. A list of the return codes can be seen in table \ref{tab:cppReturnCodes}.

\hline
34 & Could not delete output file\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\end{table}

\subsubsection{Extensibility}
The application is coded with extensibility in mind, and all parsers is therefore extending the base class \emph{Parser}.
The \emph{Parser} class contains the basic methods of setting the filename, opening for read and write and closing the open file handle.\todo[color=red,fancyline]{Explain more in-depth?}

\section{Frontend}
\subsection{jQuery}
\todo[inline]{Quick roundup about the use of jQuery}
There has been used JavaScript\footnote{Client-side scripting language for web pages} to load and visualize data. It gives a more smooth design, since the pages don't have to reload every time, but can be loaded in background.

The JavaScript framework there has been used is jQuery\footnote{JavaScript framework, see \cite{jquery} for the documentation}, because of the very well documentation. jQuery is one of the most popular JavaScript library and is free open source software. The animations for map and chart are made by using jQuery.
 
One of the techniques with jQuery is for instance AJAX\footnote{Asynchronous JavaScript and XML}, which enables the chart to send data to, and retrieve data from, the server asynchronously. Data is retrieved using XMLHttpRequest, since the data is ready in JSON\footnote{JavaScript Object Notation - representing simple data structures and associative arrays - see \cite{json}}.

If the browser doesn't support JavaScript or it isn't up-to-date, the user still have access to upload files, but not viewing data from map or chart.

\subsection{Bootstrap}
\todo[inline]{Quick roundup about the use of Boostrap and its support for smartphones and tablets}
Today many people keep them updated on the fly and to give them the opportunity, we have tried to create a design that also works on smartphones, that have smaller screens and lesser processing power. Most of the calculating is done on the server, so the requirements for client-side is almost nothing, other than showing the data that the server has performed.

The only problem with smartphone is the smaller screen, sometimes it can be difficult to get a good look, specially the charts are a problem.

We have tried accessing the software with iPhone and Android. On the iPhone the only problem was the chart, because you couldn't see the whole chart. Radar and map were working just fine, like on a normal PC.

\section{Cross-platform compability}
\label{sec:cross-platform}
The use of PHP, C++ and MySQL allows the execution of the application on almost all platforms, because the technologies used are open source and available on most platforms.

We have, however, chosen to drop support for all version of Internet Explorer, because this would increase development time drastically -- time we did not have.
