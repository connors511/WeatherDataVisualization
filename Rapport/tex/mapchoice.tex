\chapter{Map choice}
We considered two options in the selection of map - Openstreetmap and Google maps. We have tried using Google maps on Google, Facebook, etc.. The second attempt of a weather application were using Google maps, so at the beginning we were thinking about using Google maps.

After reading about the two maps, it became Openstreetmap. We did this partly because of Google wants money if the map is used for commercial purposes. This wasn't the way we were thinking about open source.

Openstreetmap wasn't that difficult to work with, due to the well documentation from leaflet\footnote{Documentations for Openstreetmap - http://leaflet.cloudmade.com}.
