\chapter{Map choice}
We considered two options in the selection of map - Openstreetmap and Google maps. We had used google maps before from many other sites, like google, facebook, etc. and the older weather project were using google maps. Openstreetmap were new for us.\\
After reading about the two maps, we selected openstreetmap. We did this partly because of google wants money if the map are used for commercial purposes. This wasn't the way we were thinking about opensource.\\
Openstreetmap wasn't that difficult to work with due to the documentations from leaflet\footnote{Documentations for openstreetmap - http://leaflet.cloudmade.com}.
