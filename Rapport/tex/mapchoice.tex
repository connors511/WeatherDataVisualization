\chapter{Map choice}
We considered two options in the selection of map - Openstreetmap and Google maps. We have tried using google maps on google, facebook, etc.. The older weather project were using google maps, so at the beginning we were thinking about using google maps
After reading about the two maps, it became openstreetmap. We did this partly because of google wants money if the map are used for commercial purposes. This wasn't the way we were thinking about opensource.\\
Openstreetmap wasn't that difficult to work with, due to the documentations from leaflet\footnote{Documentations for openstreetmap - http://leaflet.cloudmade.com}.
