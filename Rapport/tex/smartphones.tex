\chapter{Smartphones}
Today many people keep them updated on the fly and to give them the opportunity, we have tried to create a design that also works on smartphones, that have smaller screens and lesser processing power. Most of the calculating is done on the server, so the requirements for client-side is almost nothing, other than showing the data that the server has performed.\\
The only problem with smartphone is the smaller screen, sometimes it can be difficult to get a good look, specially the charts are a problem.\\
We have tried accessing the software with iPhone and Android. On the iPhone the only problem was the chart, because you couldn't see the whole chart. Radar and map were working just fine, like on a normal PC.
