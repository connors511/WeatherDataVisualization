\chapter{Smartphones}
Today many people keep them updated on the fly and to give them the opportunity, we have tried to create a design that also works on smartphones, that have smaller screens and lesser processing power. Most of the calculating is done on the server, so the requirements for client-side is almost nothing, except showing the data that the server has performed.

The only problem with smartphone is the smaller screen, sometimes it can be difficult to get a good look, specially the charts are a problem.
We tried access the software with iPhone and Android. On the iPhone the only problem was the chart, because you couldn't see the whole chart.
